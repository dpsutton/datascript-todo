# DataScript ToDo Sample Application

### Development Build

``` bash
lein figwheel none
```

This should crank up a development build viewable at [http://0.0.0.0:3449](http://0.0.0.0:3449). It includes CIDER middleware so you can connect with CIDER from emacs or your favorite nrepl client.

### Emacs and CIDER

You can run `lein figwheel none` from the command line or just `m-x cider-jack-in-clojurescript` from emacs and select the repl type as `figwheel`.
